We divide the spectrum in a hard part after 4 kev and a soft part
forthe hard part, we begin with a baseline model of a powerlaw and the galactic obscutration , we find that the power law is so flat and we
we know our source is a NLRG so it is obscured, and so we consider and intrinsic Nh and we do and F-test and we found that
the new model has a significance of :
76.24 33
44.39 32

the we plot and look at the residuals and find a significant emission around the fe- k line, we fit it and found an f test signifiant of blaa blaa.

for the soft part we also begin with power law and galactiv Nh, then we fit again for the thermal emission and found an f test significance of bla blaa

So we

ftest 

85/50
80/?8
