help #to know how to use it, help commandname to know how to use the command
inp listobs #check parameters of listobs before interactive mode
vis = 'filename' #set the file of listobs then inp listobs to check
listobs #check the log window, there are more contents
plotants # plot antennas structure
plotms #open the interactive window, if there has been something, close the window and use 'default plotms' and reopen it 
#in plotms, in -data-browse to select the file. in the axes, to plot UV plane by selecting Uwave Vwave. to plot the amplitude and time, set AMP and time to x and y axis. and amp vs uvwave, see some examples in tutorial file
#you can also in -data-selection to choose the scan, the field you wan to plot or in -page, choose -iteration-axis as scan or field and plot it, by clicking the arrow at bottom, UV plane can be shown for each scan(field)
#also, in display, colorize allows to give color to each scan......
#field is the target area, scan is the ID of duration of each observation
#check the log window to find the data you don't need
inp flagdata #check everything, there are some modes, you can use these modes to flag your data. type help flagdata to know how to use
mode='manual' or mode='quack' #see details of the 2 modes by help flagdata 
#flag is to identify the bad data (the data you don't like), if you flag it, the data would be excluded.
go flagdata #do it, then check if it works in plotms (tick the reload at the bottom and do above steps which you like).for example, scan 1 should be flagged for short time obs.
inp flagmanager #flagmanager is to restore your flag settings, set mode = 'save' or 'restore', you can give your flag a name call=''
go flagmanager #do it
