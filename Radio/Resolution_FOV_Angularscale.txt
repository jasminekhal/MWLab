angular resolution = 1/312800*206265=0.6594149616368287 ~ 0.66 = size of the beam = 0.11*6
largest angular scale = 1/4300*206265=47.96860465116279 ~ 47.97

average central frequency = (2051+2563)/2 = 2307 Mhz
average central lambda = c/2307 = 13 cm

central frequency = spw0 2051, spw2 2563
central lambda = spw0 14.63 cm,spw2 11.70cm

(average) FOV = 13/2500*206265 = 1072.6 arcsec

cell size = angular resolution /6 = 0.11 (6 is our choise, should respect niquist criterium aka at least 2)
